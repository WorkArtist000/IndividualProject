# Gym ChatBot 
-----------------------
## Project Description 
A gym chatbot system that responds to client reviews and answer questions about the gym. The system will be able to produce relevant questions for the client and will even respond to any questions posed by the user in order to act as a communication line between the gym management and their clients. Additionally the application can advise the user on the local temperature surrounding the gym 

### Usage

The chat bot will respond to general forms of greetings (better responses and understanding than previous iteration) and prompt the user to leave a review.
